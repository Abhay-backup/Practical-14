·         On click of the “Edit” link, the user should be displayed a page that can update the records

·         On click of the “Delete” link, the user should be asked for confirmation with Yes/No button & on click of Yes button that record should be deleted.

·         Implement search functionality to search records into the database by Name field using the AJAX.

·         Implement paging functionality in the listing page so that only 10 records should be displayed at a time and also display a list of page numbers, So on a click of each page number records corresponding to that page number should be displayed.
